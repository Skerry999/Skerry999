## I'm a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer currently working on Neglected Tropical Diseases with Helen Keller Intl. I focus on survey development, data collection, and analysis. 

## I work mostly in R and SQL, and I'm looking to strengthen my analytical skills with new R packages. I eventually plan to learn more Python to strengthen my understanding of machine learning techniques.
